    "Sure, fire away buddy",
    "Taliesin: We have been traveling for months now I you haven’t said why you volunteered for this mission. It seems very odd to me that anyone would volunteer for this sort of mission. From what studies I have been programed with humans are very social creatures and can have a great deal of difficulty being alone for extended periods of time.",
    "Taliesin: From what I have been programed with this was once used as punishment called “Solitary Confinement”. It was one of the many reasons that I was made, as it was deemed to much of a risk to have a true one-person mission.",
    "Well you’re not wrong there it can be hard for most of us humans to deal with being completely alone for extended periods of time. But it’s never really been something that I’ve struggled with, couldn’t for the life of me tell you why. Maybe I’m just wired a bit different than most, I’m sure it’s one of the many reasons why I got picked for this mission. ",
    "Taliesin: But that doesn’t answer my query, sorry question, as to why you decided to volunteer for this mission. Being okay being alone is not equate being content being alone in a spaceship. And from what I have observed, you are quite content now which makes this even more puzzling to me.",

I don’t really know how to explain it, but I’ve always felt this calling to come out into this void between the stars. And maybe that’s why I seem so content to you is because I feel like I’m finally out where I belong.",
    "I remember watching Sci-Fi movies and reading books about space and all I ever wanted was to be able to fly among the stars. So, when I heard that the governments were putting this mission together, I jumped at the chance to volunteer because this is what I had wanted to do all my life.",
    "Taliesin: Thank you for answering my question so honestly, I don’t have a designation for the feeling that you describe. But it seems to be the human equivalent of a primary directive for AI, however that just brings forward more questions than it answers. Could I ask you some more questions?",

Just something to show that life on Earth isn’t unique but that life is able to exist throughout the galaxy.",

But if we can find evidence of something that could make corporations or governments a boatload of money then I’m sure that more missions will be approved before we even get back to Earth.",
